# ISIC 2024 - Skin Cancer Detection with 3D-TBP

## Description
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to tackle the ISIC 2024 - Skin Cancer Detection with 3D-TBP Kaggle competition. The project involves preprocessing the dataset with oversampling of the minority class and undersampling of the majority class to address class imbalance issues. The model is trained to detect skin cancer with high accuracy using advanced techniques and data augmentation strategies.

## Features
CNN Architecture: Custom CNN model optimized for skin cancer detection.
Data Augmentation: Techniques applied to improve model performance and generalization.
Class Balancing: Oversampling and undersampling methods used to handle class imbalance.
